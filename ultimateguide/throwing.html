                In Ultimate frisbee, there are two throws that are essential for you to be a good ultimate player. They are called the backhand and the forehand. The backhand is a super basic throw that you see everyone do, but a way to make it better is to really utilize your pivot foot. If you step really far, you can step out of your blocker's range and line up a shot really well.

                Another throw, the forehand, is a bit trickier to get but such a versitile and quick throw. It is done by making a peace sign and putting those two fingers on the bottom of the disc, with your thumb on the outside. Then, making sure you keep the disc level with the ground, you snap your wrist back, and then forwards, releasing the disc on the forward flick. It is a little tricky, but the most important thing is to make sure the release is completely flat, so the disc flies straight.

                There is a throw called the hammer, which is really fun to use, but is really a long bomb kind of throw. It is made by the same grip as the forehand, but you throw it over your head, angled almost vertically but not quite. It should turn upside down in the air and go fairly straight. Catching this one is tricky though, so be careful.

            <p>A few throws that are just kind of fun are called the scooby and the chicken wing. The scooby is a little invented throw where you put your thumb and flat of your palm inside the disc and your fingers on the outside, and you throw it outwards from yourself. The chicken wing is a side arm pass where just your thumb is under the disc, and your fingers are on top, and you side arm throw it. It kind of looks like a chicken wing, so that is why it is called that.</p>
