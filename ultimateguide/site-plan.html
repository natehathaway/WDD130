      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of my website will be for anyone wanting to play ultimate frisbee but don’t know how. They can look at how the game works, and how to throw the disc in key ways to play well, as well as where to get your own disc to practice. This can also be a way to learn how to throw better, as most people only know one throw. This website will have multiple ways to throw the disc, so those wanting to hone their skills are also welcome.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Rules and Regulations
This website will have the rules for playing ultimate “frisbee” according to the UDL, so that people can know how an actual official game is played, how many players on each team, and be able to enjoy the sport better.  This will be a great informational page on how it is played, and good practices in the game of Ultimate “frisbee.” People will come to the site because they want to play more but they don’t know how to set up the game, or they can play but they want to get better, learn more throws, or just improve on them.

      <h3>Throwing Tips</h3>
      <p>
        Throwing Tips
It will also have different ways to throw a disc, such as the backhand throw, the forehand throw, the hammer, and a few fun ones that I have picked up, with a short tutorial on how to do it so they can practice and become better at that. It is just text, and I will try to put pictures showing the throws, but it might be difficult to learn from just reading.  It will also have some throws that are my own personal flair, which are very fun to do and enhance the ultimate frisbee experience. Two other throws I will explain are called the Scooby and the Chicken Wing.
Throwing Angles
Also, the website will show different angles of throwing, the “inside-out” and the “outside-in.” These 2 angles make a lot of difference in opening the space you can throw to and are an essential part of ultimate frisbee in the UDL. Being able to set up your throw to angle in a different way than straight makes it harder to be blocked and opens your options in the field.

      <h3>Gear Up</h3>
      <p>
        Gear Up
This site will also include a few different brands of discs that I recommend and general prices on them, for people who want to get their own discs. This will enable them to get the right equipment, as the official discs used have a specific weight and shape, the weight being 175g and the shape will be shown in pictures. I don’t feel the need to include links because someone wanting to buy one would just be able to google it or shop for it online, so I could include an amazon link, but I don’t know if that would be effective or not.
Website Goals
After visiting the site, they will likely want to go get a disc of their own and go out and practice these throws. And it will also have some info on the types of shoes that are good to wear and if there is other equipment that you might need. Or they might want to get some friends together and start playing, which is what I want to accomplish with this website. The information needed to do what is told on my site besides what is already there, is where the nearest field is. They will come to my site because it will be laid out in a very appealing way and there will be no hassle on the page, it will be simple and straight to the point.
