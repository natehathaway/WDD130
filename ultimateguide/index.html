            <h1>Ultimate Rules</h1>
            <p>
                The rules of Ultimate are relatively simple. The game is played with 7 players on each team, on a field with touchdowns on either side that span the entire width of the field. The game is usually played to 7 touchdowns, but all of these can be adjusted for the situation you are in! Play starts with the Ultimate equivalent of a football "kickoff," called a "throw-off." One player throws the disc across the field to the other side. The opposing team can either pick it up where it lands and begin play, or catch it and begin play. However, if a person tries to catch it and fumbles it, it is technically a turnover. Most pickup games omit this rule, but it is up to you!
                The play of the game is fairly simple. While you are holding the disc, you cannot move. You can have a pivot foot and pivot around, but that foot has to stay where it is. You move the disc forward by throwing it to your teammates, who are running around trying to get open to receive the disc. Once you catch it, you cannot move and must throw it from where you stand. A point is scored when you catch the disc in the touchdown zone. Turnovers occur when the disc touches the ground for any reason during your possesion or if an opposing team member catches the disc. Play then starts for the other team either where the disc landed or where the person caught it, going the other direction. If the disc goes out of bounds, it is a turnover and the other team starts on the sideline closest to where the disc went. When the player is holding the disc, they can be guarded, but you are not allowed to hit their hand or the disc out of their hand, only interfere after the disc is thrown. Fouls in this sport are self-called, even at the professional level, and typically are called if a player holding the disc gets hit with interference during his or her throw. Your job on defense is to try and knock the disc out of the sky or catch it before your opponent does.
